# Graphing_Calculator
Graphing Calculator coded in c# and SDL2
This is an individual project in which I tried to improve my c# skills by using the
SDL2 library and the c# language by creating an algorithm that generates an infinite
2D world with correctly asigned coordinates to the grid and preserving in variables 
the position of the camera and build the world in relation to it, so the initial coordinates
can be changed without issues.
